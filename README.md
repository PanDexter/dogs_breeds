# Dog breeds app
## General info

App is fetching data from https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ and showing it.

Features:
* show list of breeds
* show list of breed photos
* add photo to favourite
* remove photo from favourite
* show favourite photo
* filter favourite photo based on breed

Both favourite list and breed list are stored in database to show it to the user even if there is no internet connection.

TODO:
* improve UI design (I'm not designer unfortunately)
* refactor to Jetpack Compose when have time to experiment
